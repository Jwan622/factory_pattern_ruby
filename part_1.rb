      duck = Duck.new("Duck#{i}")
      @ducks << duck

# run the code

pond = Pond.new(3)
pond.simulate_one_day

# we need frogs now with the same interface as ducks

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name

  def speak
    puts("Frog #{@name} says Crooooaaaak!")
  end

# But there is a problem with the Pond classâ€”right there in the initialize method you are explicitly creating ducks:

# so how do we decide what class to use, duck or frog?
